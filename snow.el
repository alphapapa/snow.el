;;; Notes:

;; TODO: Add a fireplace and window panes looking out on the snowy
;; scene.  See <https://github.com/johanvts/emacs-fireplace>.

;; FIXME: If the pixel-display-width of " " and "‚ùÑ" are not the same,
;; the columns in the buffer will dance around.  This is annoying and
;; was hard to track down, because it doesn't make any sense for it to
;; be the case when using a monospaced font, but apparently it can
;; happen (e.g. with "Fantasque Sans Mono").

;; FIXME: Change buffer height/width back to use the full window
;; (changed it to use 1- while debugging).

;; NOTE: Be sure to preserve whitespace in the `snow-background'
;; string, otherwise the text-properties will become corrupted and
;; cause an error on load.

;;; Commentary:

;; Let it snow in Emacs!  Command `snow' displays a buffer in which it
;; snows.  The storm varies in intensity, a gentle breeze blows at
;; times, and snow accumulates on the terrain in the scene.
